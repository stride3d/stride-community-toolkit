This page provides an overview of the basic examples available for code-only projects in Stride. You can explore each example by clicking on the links available in the menu on the left. Each linked example page contains detailed code snippets and explanations.

Additionally, for those who prefer a more interactive approach, we provide a console application that allows you to run these examples directly. This console app, available in the [`Stride.CommunityToolkit.Examples`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/tree/main/src/Stride.CommunityToolkit.Examples) project, offers an interactive menu for selecting and running the examples.

Here's a glimpse of the interactive menu provided by the console application:
