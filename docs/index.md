## 👋 Introduction

The [Stride Community Toolkit](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit) is a set of C# helpers and [extensions](manual/animation-extensions/index.md) designed to enhance your experience with the [Stride Game Engine](https://www.stride3d.net/). It simplifies and streamlines routine development tasks 🛠️, making it easier to build applications for Stride using .NET 8 🎉.

> [!TIP]
> Experienced developers can dive straight into the source, these helpers are thin wrappers over Stride APIs, meant to accelerate iteration (not hide the engine).

## 📦 Libraries  

Each library focuses on a specific concern (core helpers, physics integration, UI/debug aids, etc.):

## 🚀 Fast Iteration (Preview Status)

This toolkit favors momentum and rapid 🏃 feature delivery. Expect:

- Breaking changes between releases (namespaces / APIs may shift).
- Early access to experimental helpers.
- Occasional rough edges in less‑traveled code paths.

Stability will improve as patterns settle. Pin a version if you need consistency.

This approach allows us to quickly iterate and integrate new features and improvements. We believe this pace serves the needs of developers who are looking for cutting-edge tools and are comfortable with a more dynamic environment.

## 🔧 Installation

The toolkit, available as a 📦 [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/StrideCommunity), can be integrated into new or existing Stride Game C# projects. For more information on how to get started, please refer to the [Getting Started](manual/getting-started.md) page.

## 🛠️ Toolkit Repository

The Stride Community Toolkit is an open-source, MIT-licensed project hosted on GitHub and supported by the community. Access the source code or contribute 🤝 to the toolkit on its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit).

Found a gap? Open an [issue](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/pulls). Even small doc clarifications help. See [Contributing](contributing/index.md) section for guidelines.
