# Code-Only

## Why choose Code-Only over Stride Game Studio?

There are many reasons to prefer the code-only approach, especially if you:

- Prefer not to install additional software (no Stride editor required).
- Want to learn C# or game development in a straightforward, code-first way.
- Aim to get started quickly with minimal setup.
- Enjoy hands-on coding, whether you're new or experienced.
- Want visual 2D/3D output rather than console-only results.
- Prefer to ease into game programming, mastering the basics before using a full editor.
- Find traditional editor-driven workflows overwhelming.
- Need to prototype gameplay quickly.
- Want an efficient path to core game development concepts and practices.
- Want to evaluate Stride's performance and features without the editor overhead.

## Extensions and helpers

Our code-only extensions and helpers provide a streamlined path for building games programmatically with the Stride Game Engine. While not required, they save time, especially for newcomers, by offering sensible defaults and shortcut APIs tailored to code-only projects.

These extensions are opinionated but flexible. If the defaults don't fit your needs, you can inspect their implementation and adapt them to your preferences.

Although designed with beginner friendliness in mind, experienced users can also benefit from these utilities as a solid foundation to build, modify, and extend for more advanced scenarios.
