# ImGui UI

This example demonstrates how to integrate [ImGui](https://github.com/HexaEngine/Hexa.NET.ImGui) with the Stride game engine to render an immediate‑mode UI overlay for in‑game tools, debugging, and live controls.

This project will show how to: 
- Initialize and configure the ImGui integration
- Draw ImGui windows, menus, and controls every frame
- Handle input events and toggle UI visibility
- Display real‑time stats or debug panels
