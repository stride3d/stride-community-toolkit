# Box2D.NET Physics

This example demonstrates how to integrate Box2D.NET with Stride to run a fixedâ€‘step 2D physics simulation, create dynamic/kinematic/static bodies, and visualize interactions in a 2D scene.

This example shows how to:
- Initialize a reusable 2D physics world and bridge it to Stride entities
- Configure gravity
- Create bodies and shapes
- Synchronize entity transforms from physics bodies
