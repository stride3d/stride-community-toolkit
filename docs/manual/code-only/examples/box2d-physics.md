# Box2D.NET Physics

This example demonstrates how to integrate Box2D.NET with Stride to run a fixedâ€‘step 2D physics simulation, create dynamic/kinematic/static bodies, and visualize interactions in a 2D scene.

The `Program.cs` file shows how to:
- Initialize a reusable 2D physics world and bridge it to Stride entities
- Configure gravity
- Create bodies and shapes
- Synchronize entity transforms from physics bodies

> [!NOTE]
> This example requires the additional NuGet package `Box2D.NET`. Make sure to install it before running the code.
