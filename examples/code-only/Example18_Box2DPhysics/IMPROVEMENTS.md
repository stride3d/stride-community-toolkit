# Box2DSimulation.cs Improvements (Updated)

This document tracks improvements for Box2DSimulation.cs, inspired by Box2D.NET capabilities and BepuSimulation patterns.

## Supported by Box2D.NET
- Contact event system (collision callbacks)
- Sensor event system (trigger volumes)
- Kinematic/static/dynamic body creation
- Raycast and AABB/circle queries
- Collision filtering (groups/masks, custom filter callbacks)
- Physics property management (gravity, hertz, damping, etc.)
- Debug draw (B2DebugDraw)
- Joints (distance, revolute, etc.)
- Performance stats (profile, body/contact counts)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Contact Event System 🎯 (**High Priority**)
- [x] Box2D.NET exposes contact event arrays (contactBeginEvents, contactEndEvents, contactHitEvents, etc.)
- [ ] Add handler registration and event processing in Box2DSimulation
- [ ] Expose EnableContactEvents/EnableHitEvents properties

### 2. Sensor Event System 🚨 (**High Priority**)
- [x] Box2D.NET exposes sensor event arrays (sensorBeginEvents, sensorEndEvents)
- [ ] Add handler registration and event processing in Box2DSimulation
- [ ] Expose EnableSensorEvents property

### 3. Enhanced Body Creation 🏗️ (**High Priority**)
- [x] Dynamic body creation exists
- [ ] Add CreateKinematicBody and CreateStaticBody methods

### 4. Advanced Raycast System 🎯 (**High Priority**)
- [x] Box2D.NET supports raycasting and queries
- [ ] Add Raycast and RaycastAll methods to Box2DSimulation

### 5. Collision Filtering System 🔒 (**Medium Priority**)
- [x] Box2D.NET supports custom filter callbacks and group/mask fields
- [ ] Add SetCollisionFilter and CollisionMatrix support

### 6. Physics Properties Management ⚙️ (**Medium Priority**)
- [x] Gravity, hertz, damping, etc. are available
- [ ] Expose as properties on Box2DSimulation

### 7. Debug Drawing Support 🎨 (**Medium Priority**)
- [x] B2DebugDraw and B2DrawContext are available
- [x] Add SetDebugDraw and DebugDraw methods

### 8. Component Integration System 🔧 (**Medium Priority**)
- [ ] Add ISimulationUpdate registration and invocation

### 9. Transform Interpolation 🎬 (**Low Priority**)
- [ ] Add basic transform interpolation for smooth visuals

### 10. Body Component System 📦 (**Low Priority**)
- [x] Box2DBodyComponent stub exists
- [ ] Integrate with simulation and expose velocity/force APIs

### 11. World Querying Improvements 🔍 (**Low Priority**)
- [x] OverlapPoint exists
- [ ] Add OverlapAABB and OverlapCircle methods

### 12. Joint System Support 🔗 (**Low Priority**)
- [x] Joints are supported in Box2D.NET
- [ ] Add helper methods for common joints

### 13. Performance Monitoring 📊 (**Low Priority**)
- [x] B2Profile and world stats available
- [ ] Expose SimulationStats struct and GetStats method

## Example Strategy
- Add comprehensive examples in Example18_Box2DPhysics2/Program.cs

## Status
- [ ] Contact/sensor events: Not yet implemented
- [ ] Kinematic/static body creation: Not yet implemented
- [ ] Raycast: Not yet implemented
- [ ] Filtering, debug draw, and other features: Not yet implemented
